# FAST!
This is purely made to experiment with threads and see how fast we can make the simulation!
The program has plenty of weird bugs because of my lack of knowledge around threads. But it runs the simulations FAST! VERY FAST!

Reference:
This runs 1 000 000 simulations in 1min and 8 sec.
The original runs 1 000 000 +55 min (Stoped because I got tired of waiting)

The code needs plenty of work to work properly, and I am very sure I will not work on that in the future. But if you have any solutions or feedback, I am allways open for feedback! :)
