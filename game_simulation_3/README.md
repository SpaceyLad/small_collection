# Game simulation 3! (Because 1 and 2 didn't beat the seg fault boss)

## What is it?
It is what the name implies! Its a program made in C that simulates a simple triangle fight between a mage, warrior and ranged that has different stats.
You can simulate games as many times as you wish by modifying the argument value. When the games are done, it print the result of all the games in the terminal :]

### Tip!
In the source code, i added "int milliseconds = 0;" If you want to see how the code runs live, add a value between 100 - 1000! ;D

### How to run:
./run <number of iterations>
#### Example
./run 1000

## Why upload this?
I am amazed by the speed of C! After coding in Java and python for a long time, it has been fun to simulate projects and push amount of loop interations to over millions of rounds.
This projeced is shared so other people can try and modify it to their own desire. Add a new class, make more rules! Maybe even make something bigger out of the concept? <3

# Example with 1 run:

The source code is in the obj directory

# Example with 100000 runs:

## Welcome to Game Simulation 3!
The game that doesn't give up! (Because the previous two couldn't defeat the dreaded seg fault boss)

## So, what's this all about?
It's a C program that simulates an epic triangle battle between a mage, warrior, and ranged fighter, all with unique stats. The best part? You can run the simulation as many times as you want by tweaking the argument value. Once the games are done, you'll get to see the results of all the battles right in the terminal! Isn't that exciting?

## Oh, and here's a little tip for you:
In the source code, I added an "int milliseconds = 0;" line. Want to see the code in action in real-time? Just add a value between 100 and 1000! It's like magic! (Well, technically, it's just a C program, but let's pretend it's magic for now.)

You might be wondering why I uploaded this. Well, after coding in Java and Python for what felt like an eternity, I was blown away by the lightning-fast speed of C. Simulating projects and running millions of loop iterations has never been more fun! So, I'm sharing this project with you in the hopes that you'll enjoy it too. You can modify the code, add new classes, make new rules, and who knows? Maybe you'll even create something even more epic than this! <3

Here's an example of what you can expect when you run the simulation 1 time:

Result after running it 100 000 times:

## How to compile
In the working directory, simply write.
"sudo make"
  
## Note
As usual, i take full responebility for bade code practices and errors in the grammar! But feel free to reach out and tell me if you see anything that needs fixing!
Its all about learning :]
